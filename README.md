Project Title:

Rhythm: A Social Music & Karaoke Experience

Project Idea:

Rhythm is a music streaming and karaoke app built using the MERN stack. It allows users to listen to music, sing along with friends, and maintain streaks, similar to Snapchat. Users can also learn singing from professional teachers through paid lessons. The app integrates a leaderboard system, encouraging friendly competition among users based on their streaks.
